# Chapter1. Two important technologies: Spark and graphs #
+ 
+ Data points and the connections between them can give insights into:
	- Detecting frauds.
	- Collecting bio-informatics.
	- Ranking pages on the web.

+ Graphs can be used to model:
	- Computer vision.
	- Natural language processing.
	- Recommender systems.

+ Some graph analytics tools:
	- PageRank (for finding the most influential members of the network)
	- Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA - for topic modeling)
	- Clustering coefficient (to discover highly connected communities)

+ Spark Job Server:
	- add-on by Ooyala, facilitates adding a REST server to Spark.

+ Graph databases that can be used in conjunction with GraphX
	- Neo4j
	- Titan
